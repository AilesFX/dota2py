Python tools for Dota 2

So far this is just a Python "port" of [demoinfo2](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Dota_2_Demo_Format), but will probably be expanded into more useful tools for Dota 2 replays

You will need [snappy](http://code.google.com/p/snappy/) and [Google Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) installed

To run the parser either run parser.py or in Linux use the dota2py_parser script
