Python tools for Dota 2

This contains a Python port of [demoinfo2](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Dota_2_Demo_Format), but will probably be expanded into more useful tools for Dota 2 replays
You will need [snappy](http://code.google.com/p/snappy/) and [Google Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) installed

To run the parser either run parser.py or in Linux use the dota2py_parser script

To show a summary of useful information from a replay, run summary.py or dota2py_summary (this functionality is a work in progress)
